# Intermittent App Crash on API Data Fetch in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug causing intermittent crashes in a React Native application during API data fetching. The app uses `fetch` to retrieve data and renders it in a FlatList.  The issue is difficult to debug due to its intermittent nature and lack of specific error messages.

## Bug Description
The application sporadically crashes without providing clear error messages when it attempts to fetch data from a public API.  This makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing more robust error handling within the `fetch` call's `.catch` block and logging more detailed error information.  This helps identify the source of the problem and prevent app crashes.
